// Copy-remux on a worker thread, fed while the tracks are still arriving.
//
// mediabunny used to run on the offscreen document's own main thread, and a
// 700 s video occupied it for more than a minute: the document stopped
// answering messages entirely — `yts-finalize` sat in its queue for 68 s while
// the assembly was already finished — and the browser felt frozen down to the
// extensions panel. The work is identical here, it simply no longer blocks the
// thread that has to keep talking to the rest of the extension.
//
// Three findings decide the shape of this file. All three were reproduced
// against this exact vendored build (mediabunny 1.51.0).
//
// 1. Declaring a size SMALLER than the real track truncates the output in
//    SILENCE. Reads are clamped to the declared size and both the ISOBMFF and
//    the Matroska demuxer treat a slice past it as end of file, with no error.
//    That is the 14.4 MB file made from 62.8 MB of tracks in ROADMAP 3.2 — and
//    the duration check waved it through because mediabunny writes
//    `mvhd.duration` as the MAXIMUM over the output tracks, so the one complete
//    track (audio) declared the full length while the video stopped a quarter
//    of the way in. Nothing here declares a size any more.
//
// 2. A sized source cannot overlap the transfer at all for a fragmented MP4.
//    `Conversion.init` probes the LAST FOUR BYTES of the file (the mfra index)
//    the moment the source reports a size, so the parse cannot begin until the
//    final byte has arrived. Measured overlap with the previous StreamSource:
//    zero. `ReadableStreamSource` reports no size until its stream closes, so
//    the tail probe is skipped and init returns in about a tenth of a second.
//    Its cache holds references to the very chunks below, not copies.
//
// 3. `conversion.onProgress` is not free. Setting it makes `execute()`
//    precompute the duration first, and for a fragmented MP4 that is
//    `getPacket(Infinity)` — a walk to the last fragment before a single packet
//    is copied. It defeats the streaming and blows the sliding cache. The
//    document's stall guard is fed from the source's read callback instead.
//
// The bytes are transferred in, never copied. A failed mux hands them back so
// the document can still run the proven buffered path.

// Generous, and nearly free: the cache stores references to chunks this worker
// holds anyway. It only bounds how far back the parser may seek before the
// source gives up — loudly, with "Read is before the cached region".
